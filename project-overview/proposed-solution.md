# SecureCorp proposed solution can be broadly classified into 4 phases.

## Phase 1:- Designing a Secure Network Architecture
SecureCorp is actively redesigning XYZ's network architecture to meet strict business and security requirements. The team proposes a network design that features multi-layered segmentation to improve visibility and control across different network areas. This architecture includes:

- An On-Premise Network with three workstations, supporting crucial in-house operations.
- A Virtual Network, divided into specific zones for varied operational needs:
- Public DMZ: Efficiently manages external web traffic with two web servers and a load balancer.
- Private DMZ: Houses two database servers for sensitive data, isolated from direct internet access.
- Management LAN: Acts as a secure hub for the management server, coordinating network-wide administrative tasks.
- Internal LAN: Accommodates five workstations, meeting internal operational needs.
- Private Secure LAN: Features three database servers designed for high-security needs.
- Integrating a VPN Gateway creates a secure link between the on-premise network and the virtual network, enabling encrypted remote access. We strategically position security devices such as firewalls, IDS/IPS, and load balancers throughout the architecture to anchor the network's defense mechanisms and direct traffic flow following the best security practices.

## Phase 3:- Building a Secure Network Architecture in Azure

We are deploying the redesigned network architecture within Azure, which involves:
- Creating two Azure Virtual Networks, specifically labeled for DMZ and Internal operations.
- Configuring subnets to delineate zones for public access, private data management, administrative operations, and secure transactions.
- Deploying Virtual Machines within each subnet to form a solid operational framework, ensuring both functionality and security.
- Enhancing connectivity and access control with secure network routing and a VPN setup, providing direct and protected access to the Azure Internal LAN.

## Phase 2:- Continuous Monitoring with a SIEM

We're implementing an ELK Server in the private DMZ and using comprehensive log ingestion via Filebeat to enable real-time monitoring and alerting. 
- We're setting up custom alerts for DoS attacks, brute force attempts, and scanning/reconnaissance activities to support proactive incident management. 
- Our Incident Response Playbook details strategic responses to potential alerts, fortifying XYZâ€™s cybersecurity posture.

## Phase 4:- Zero Trust Model

Adopting a Zero Trust Model, we're moving beyond traditional security paradigms by requiring strict verification for every network access request. This model incorporates:

- Identity Verification: We verify each user's identity to ensure authenticated and authorized access.
- Device Security: We assess devices' security posture before allowing network access.
- Application Control: We manage application access across the network.
- Data Protection: We protect sensitive data with encryption and access controls.
- Infrastructure Integrity: We maintain the security of both physical and virtual network components.
- A detailed comparative analysis showcases the Zero Trust Model's advantages over traditional network security architectures, promoting a progressive cybersecurity stance.

## Conclusion

SecureCorp's holistic strategy not only tackles the vulnerabilities unveiled by the recent breach but also builds a robust, future-oriented cybersecurity framework for XYZ. With thorough planning, cutting-edge technology, and innovative security models, XYZ is set to restore and elevate its reputation as a secure, reliable platform in the cryptocurrency exchange market.
