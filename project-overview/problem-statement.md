# Problem Statement
XYZ is the premier cryptocurrency exchange. They transact over a billion trades everyday and are considered to be one of the most reliable and secure exchanges in the world. Due to their rapid growth, they've faced challenges in scaling their security posture.

The largest challenge they've faced is with their Perimeter Network Security being secure. The networking team was overburdened with the rapid growth and a majority of the network infrastructure was built insecurely.

Due to a lack of visibility and a lack of proper access control setup on the different network segments, it was inevitable that a breach took place! **XYZ **was hit with a massive attack in which their network was breached and their internal servers were compromised resulting in over 500 Bitcoin being stolen!

Needing to get the bottom of this breach and resolving their current perimeter issues they've contracted you from SecureCorp, a world renowned cybersecurity consulting firm. Your job is to redesign their network architecture securely and set up a SIEM to monitor against future attacks.
