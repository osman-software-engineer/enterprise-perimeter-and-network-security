# Enterprise Perimeter and Network Security Portfolio

## Introduction

Welcome to my "Enterprise Perimeter and Network Security" portfolio, a key component of the Enterprise Security Nanodegree program. This course and its accompanying repository showcase my journey through the complexities of securing enterprise networks, focusing on designing robust network architectures and employing cutting-edge security practices.

## Course Overview
The "Enterprise Perimeter and Network Security" course is intricately designed to explore the depth of securing enterprise network architectures. It extensively covers:
## Lessons and Learning Outcomes

### Lesson 1: Network Security Architecture

- Identify weaknesses in network topologies.
- Design the placement of security devices in an enterprise network.
- Employ the SABSA framework to align enterprise business and security needs.

### Lesson 2: Building an Enterprise Network

- Facilitate connections from public to private networks over a NAT gateway.
- Partition a virtual network into multiple segments.
- Construct a VPN solution to enable enterprise network connectivity.

### Lesson 3: Continuous Monitoring with a SIEM

- Deploy a SIEM system.
- Configure alerts and monitor network traffic.
- Develop an Incident Response Playbook.

### Lesson 4: Zero Trust

- Define the principles of Zero Trust.
- Identify key components in a Zero Trust architecture.
- Formulate a Zero Trust model.

## Project: Securing the Perimeter

### Objective

My capstone project for this course, "Securing the Perimeter," involved several key tasks aimed at enhancing the security posture of an enterprise network, including:
- **Network Segmentation**: Implementing various security topologies to safeguard network segments.
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Ensuring minimal access levels across the network to enhance security.
- **VPN Implementation**: Establishing secure remote access through VPNs.
- **SIEM Configuration**: Utilizing SIEM for comprehensive network monitoring and security incident alerting.
- **Incident Response Playbooks**: Developing actionable strategies for potential security incidents.
- **Zero Trust Design**: Analyzing and implementing a Zero Trust model, moving away from traditional security paradigms.

### Skills and Insights

Through this project, I've honed my abilities in designing and implementing security measures within enterprise networks, particularly in network architecture, security monitoring, and incident response. It has also deepened my understanding of the zero-trust model, highlighting its importance in modern cybersecurity strategies.

## Key Tools and Technologies

Throughout this course, I have worked extensively with:
- **Microsoft Azure**:  A cloud computing platform run by Microsoft
